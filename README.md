==========
A simplistic vision-based learning algorithm to allow a Raspberry Pi to learn to launch a ball into a goal.

NOTE: This project was a project for my CS202 class and due to time constraints was never completed. It serves mostly as a reference for OpenCV blob detection and simplistic PWM control between a Raspberry Pi and an FPGA board. If both Max and Foster gain access to the parts of the robot again, development may continue but it is unlikely.
